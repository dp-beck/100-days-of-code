# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blog project, setting up a skeleton Express app to implement as RESTful api.

**Thoughts:** It took me awhile to figure out why a CLI command was not working as I thought, but I fixed it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I connected my backend for the blog project to a MongoDB database, and I defined Mongoose schemas for comments and posts.

**Thoughts:** Progress is slow, but I think this project will solidify my knowledge of setting up a RESTful api via Express JS.

### Day 3: January 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the routes for my blog's API, and I wrote some dummy controller functions for when these routes get called. Next task is to fill in those controller functions.

**Thoughts:** Good day. I'm happy that I am still coding on the weekends.

**Today's Progress**: I finished the backend API for my blog.

### Day 6: January 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I started the public front end for the blog, using Vite and React. I wrote up the basic functionality for fetching the posts.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to remember all of the intricacies of React after being away from it for a couple months while learning backend.

### Day 7: January 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Working on public frontend for blog still. Added fetch for comments; updated component for showing posts with formatted date of publication; updated comments schema on backend so that it contains a ref to the post.

**Thoughts:** Today felt like I did not get a lot accomplished.
