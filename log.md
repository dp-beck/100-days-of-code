# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blog project, setting up a skeleton Express app to implement as RESTful api.

**Thoughts:** It took me awhile to figure out why a CLI command was not working as I thought, but I fixed it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I connected my backend for the blog project to a MongoDB database, and I defined Mongoose schemas for comments and posts.

**Thoughts:** Progress is slow, but I think this project will solidify my knowledge of setting up a RESTful api via Express JS.

### Day 3: January 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I wrote the routes for my blog's API, and I wrote some dummy controller functions for when these routes get called. Next task is to fill in those controller functions.

**Thoughts:** Good day. I'm happy that I am still coding on the weekends.

**Today's Progress**: I finished the backend API for my blog.

### Day 6: January 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I started the public front end for the blog, using Vite and React. I wrote up the basic functionality for fetching the posts.

**Thoughts:** It is hard to remember all of the intricacies of React after being away from it for a couple months while learning backend.

### Day 7: January 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Working on public frontend for blog still. Added fetch for comments; updated component for showing posts with formatted date of publication; updated comments schema on backend so that it contains a ref to the post.

**Thoughts:** Today felt like I did not get a lot accomplished.

**Today's Progress**: Working on public frontend for blog still.

### Day 10: January 14, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Working on public frontend for blog still. Somewhat stuck on figuring out how to best send my comments form data to the backend using fetch

### Day 11: January 15, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Working on public frontend for blog still. Figured out how to send comments to back end, but struggled with the React logic to display the new comments as they were sent.

**Thoughts:** It doesn't feel good to be stuck. I ll tell ya that.

### Day 12: January 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out how to get the comments to display correctly. React is funky. My solution seems weird and kludgy and not sure why the original way I wrote it did not work. 

**Thoughts:** React is difficult; it seems confusing in ways it should not be.

### Day 13: January 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I finished some basic styling for the public front end for the blog project and I'm calling it at that. Tomorrow I will start to put together a basic administrator side. 

**Thoughts:** It's been getting harder and harder to maintain my efforts, but I am still committed to completing the 100 days of code. I think it will be a significant benefit to my job search, which I have already started.

### Day 14: January 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I moved on to writing up the administrator client.

**Thoughts:** NONE.

### Day 15: January 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I added the fetch functionality to the publish and unpublish buttons.

**Thoughts:** React is hard. After working on Node.JS and Express for a while, React seems more complicated because the stuff I am doing on the backend is pretty straightforward and doesn't really need to veer from established practice on how to write the code.

### Day 16: January 21, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the update publication status buttons to reflect current status.

**Thoughts:** I missed a day because I was too darn tired after taking the kids to the Great Wolf Lodge, but I am back now.

### Day 17: January 22, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I finished the rest of the functionality for the administrator front end for my blog. Since it is just a learning project. 

**Thoughts:** I've decided to stop where I was. There may be a couple bugs and the styling is non-existent. But I wanted to move on to finish the Odin Project on schedule and get started on the several projects I really want to show off in my arsenal.
