# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Blog project, setting up a skeleton Express app to implement as RESTful api.

**Thoughts:** It took me awhile to figure out why a CLI command was not working as I thought, but I fixed it.

### Day 2: January 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I connected my backend for the blog project to a MongoDB database, and I defined Mongoose schemas for comments and posts.

**Thoughts:** Progress is slow, but I think this project will solidify my knowledge of setting up a RESTful api via Express JS.
